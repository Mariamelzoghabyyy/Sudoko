ðŸ§  Sudoku Solver in Python (Backtracking + CSP)

This project is a fully functional Sudoku solver built in Python. It uses a backtracking algorithm inspired by constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) strategies to solve any standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The program reads a partially filled board, finds valid solutions recursively, and prints the completed board.

ðŸŽ¯ Features

Backtracking Algorithm: Uses a recursive backtracking search to try valid numbers in empty cells, reverting (backtracking) when a dead end is reached.

Constraint Checking: Ensures numbers are valid in their row, column, and 3x3 subgrid before placing them, following standard Sudoku rules.

Modular OOP Design: Encapsulated in a Sudoku class with methods for validation, printing, solving, and CSP integration.

Readable Console Output: Prints the Sudoku board before and after solving for easy comparison and debugging.

ðŸ§© How It Works

The solver scans the grid for the first empty cell.

It tries digits from 1 to 9 in that cell.

If the digit is valid (no conflicts in row, column, or box), it proceeds recursively.

If stuck, it backtracks and tries a different number.

The algorithm continues until the board is completely filled or determines there's no solution.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements

GUI Interface using Tkinter or PyGame.

Puzzle Generator to create random Sudoku puzzles with varying difficulty levels.

Performance Optimizations via heuristics (e.g., Most Constrained Variable or Forward Checking).
